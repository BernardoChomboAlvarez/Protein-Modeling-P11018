Running roughfit.

    Sc = STAMP score, RMS = RMS deviation, Align = alignment length
    Len1, Len2 = length of domain, Nfit = residues fitted
    Secs = no. equivalent sec. strucs. Eq = no. equivalent residues
    %I = seq. identity, %S = sec. str. identity
    P(m)  = P value (p=1/10) calculated after Murzin (1993), JMB, 230, 689-694
            (NC = P value not calculated - potential FP overflow)
